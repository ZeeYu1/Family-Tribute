        <h2>My Father</h2>
        <p>My dad was strict with me growing up—discipline came in many forms, sometimes even harsh words and punishment. But looking back now, I realize that my relationship with my father is something rare, perhaps even extraordinary compared to that of my peers. We share a bond that has grown beyond the typical father-son connection; it’s something unique, and I think we’ve truly surprised those around us with how well we get along. My dad and I are incredibly close, and he’s always been my greatest supporter.</p>
        <p>He is also one of the strongest, most resilient, and determined individuals I know. Every morning, he runs five kilometers without fail, no matter the weather. When I was about to leave for college—a school 3,000 kilometers away—he didn’t come along to drop me off. Instead, he gave me three words, words that continue to inspire me to this day: pragmatic, confident, and resilient.</p>
        <p>Dad, I love you. Thank you for being my guide, my strength, and my hero.</p>
